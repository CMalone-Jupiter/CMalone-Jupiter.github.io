<!-- # Career: -->
I graduated from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in 2019 with a Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) with first class honours. My capstone project focused on the development of a deployable ground plane segmentation system for the ‘Carlie’ mini autonomous vehicle platform. This work transitioned into the commencement of my PhD research under the supervision of Prof. Michael Milford, Assoc. Prof. Thierry Peynot and Dr Sourav Garg in 2020.

I am particularly interested in research contributing to the scene understanding capabilities of autonomous vehicles and how to improve their performance in challenging conditions. I also have a growing interest in the application of probabilistic methods to robotics and neural networks.

## Thesis:
Spatially Informed Scene Understanding for Robots and Autonomous Vehicles
## Current Work:
Investigating how Visual Place Recognition can be used to improve semantic segmentation in challenging domains (e.g. night, fog, snow, rain) without additional training.

# More Interesting Things
Growing up in a country town within Australia I was exposed to many different experiences which helped shape who I am and how I approach problems. Being the son of a livestock and station agent I have been involved with cattle work and rural property business for most of my life. In addition, many of my friends and family own and run crop farms which has given me the opportunity to learn about that side of the industry too and work with different heavy machinery.
